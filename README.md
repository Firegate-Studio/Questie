# Version Alpha.3 - *Coming Soon*
This version introduces the character editor that allows creating new characters for use with the quest editor. The character editor has new blocks for creating quests, including the **Kill** Task block where the player must kill a specific amount of a particular character to complete the quest and the **Talk** Task block where the player must talk with a specific character to complete the quest.
